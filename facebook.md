You can have a "Watch This Movie" tab righ on your movie's Facebook page: 

![example facebook tab](screenshots/onlyGodForgivesFacebookTab.png)

To add the button, perform the following:

(*This assumes you have already published the page and supplied the page URL to your GWI contact. If the page is not yet published, your GWI contact will work with you to get the tab setup*).

1. Login to Facebook as an admin user of your movie page.
 
2. Navigate to this page: [http://www.facebook.com
/add.php?api_key=167888973227524&pages=1](http://www.facebook.com
/add.php?api_key=167888973227524&pages=1)
 
3. Here you will see a menu of pages that you administrate. Choose your movie fan page.
 
4. You’ll see the GoWatchIt “Watch This Movie” application appear as a tab which your viewers can click and open!
 
5. We strongly recommend you display the GoWatchIt tab in the top level of tabs displayed for maximum user engagement. To reorder the tabs, from the main page of your page-admin section, you can edit each tab of the FB fan page. (Hover and click edit pencil) An option on the next page allows you to switch places with other elements.This should allow you to move the GoWatchIt tab to the desired position.
 
### Required Attribution
 
The GoWatchIt widget is completely free to use but we do request that you use the following attribution:

* On your Facebook "About" page (https://www.facebook.com/Your-Page/info), we ask that you place a text link to your movie's page on GoWatchIt.This can be either in the "short description" or "long description" sections.

* We will provide a bitly link, and you’ll just need to enter the following text:"GoWatchIt: Buy, Rent, MOVIE TITLE -http://bit.ly/BLABLA". The bitly link will direct people to your film's page on GoWatchIt, and functions as another point of entry, which we'll be able to track.
